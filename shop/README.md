# Shop
This folder contains the files necessary to randomize the shop offerings. For now it's just one file but can be later upgraded like the Item/Entrance/Enemy randomizers to specify certain randomization algorithms.

## randomizeShop
A simple shop randomization implementation that randomly picks a subset of all valid shop items without any regard to offering healing or weapons for breaking vertical breakable walls.
